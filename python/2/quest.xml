<text id="quest_text">In Python, data can be stored in variables. A variable can have any single-word name, for example 'x', 'word' and 'my_variable' are all variable names.

Some words can't be used as variable names, these are known as keywords. For example 'print' is a keyword. 

Try assigning the String "Hello" to a variable 'my_word' and printing out this variable.

<text id="hint_text">To assign "Hello" to a variable write this:

	my_word = "Hello"
